# Description
The repository contains two main types of codes
- Implementations of important data structures which are big enough that i can't just rewrite them again every time i want to practice. So i just read them before an interview.
- The other set includes a list of very specific problems which i feel need to be revisited before an interview. Its my own list, so might not work for you.
